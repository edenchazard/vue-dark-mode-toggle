# Vue Dark Mode Toggle

Add a sleek, animated dark mode toggle to your Vue 3 project. It handles everything you need with a composable and a component.

Check out the [demo here!](https://edenchazard.github.io/vue-dark-mode-toggle/).

## VueDarkModeToggle

A component that can be used with the composable. The component doesn't decide if dark mode is enabled itself, but it accepts a `dark-mode-enabled' prop and will display the appropriate sun/moon graphic.

## useDarkMode

A composable to handle all dark mode related things. Combine it with the component for maximum dark mode-ness. ðŸ˜Ž
